<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>The goals that I am working to in my personal and professional life are to become a athlete/trainer. The experiences that led me here were when I kid my dad and me would always have fun playing sports he wanted to become a pro athlete to but he got hurt so I'm going to live out his dream. I am working towards these goals by going to the gym everyday. I also had my dad helping me get to my goals by bringing me to and from practice. The values I consider most necessary for my success is staying true to myself and don't let anyone convince you, you can't. The short term goals I hope to accomplish in the near future is to make the all-American bowl. The all-American bowl can help you get noticed by scouts all around the world. The character traits I want to be most known for are my kindness and how funny I am. I want to be most known for my work ethic.</p>
